Reconnaissance is the **first and most critical phase** of any engagement. The goal is to gather as much information about the target as possible without triggering detection.

## Passive Recon

Gather information without directly interacting with the target.

## Active Recon

Directly interact with the target to enumerate live hosts, open ports, and services.
